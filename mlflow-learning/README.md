Lifecycle of Data Science Project

1. Data Preparation
2. EDA
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training
5. Model Validation
6. Deploymwnt
7. Monitoring

Data Scientists leverages mlflow for:

1. Experiment tracking and hypothesis testing.
2. Code Structuring.
3. Model Packaging and dependency management.
4. Evaluating hyperparamenters tuning.
    -> Train model -> parameters
        -> Tracks hyperparameter tining
            -> visualization graph.
5. Compare results of models retaining over time.

MLops/ML Professional:

1. Manages the lifecyle of trained models, both pre and post deployment.
2. Deploy models securely to the production environment.
3. Manage entire deployment dependencies.

Prompt Engineering users:

1. Evaluate and experiment with LLMs
2. Create custom prompts and experiment.
3. Deciding on the best model suitable for project requirement.

Usecases:

1. Experiment Tracking -> Track parameters and metrics - UI Based
2. Model Selection and Deployment.
3. Model performance monitoring.
4. Collaborative project.
